## Description
In this challenge, there is code which builds out a weather app. This weather app has a search bar which takes in two APIs, one which targets a geocode for a city and releases the longitude and latitude of that city, and another which takes in those two paramteres and releases the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and uv index. There is also code for a 5-day weather forecast, which takes in the previous API format and builds out the next 5 days with the same information. In both the weather section and the 5-day forecast, the accurate dates are shown. Within the search bar, if a user does not enter any city, an alert is shown to the user. Upon the user clicking the search button, there is another section which saves all of the user's previous searches, and those themselves become buttons which show the weather and the 5-day forecast.
